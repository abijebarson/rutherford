# Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment - Simulation

This is a simulation of the *Classical* Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment.
You can change the radius of the Gold atom to see that the alpha particles are allowed when the concentration of charge is larger and backscattered when the radius is tiny compared to the atom.

## Getting Started

Assuming that you already have python and git(optional), to get started, you need to either *clone* or *download* this repo into your computer as shown below:
(these commands can be run on command prompt or powershell or terminal)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abijebarson/rutherford
```

## Dependencies

Before you begin, you might have to install dependencies just as shown below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

```bash
python rfd.py
```

## Sample Output

Below is a sample output from this program with real alpha particle charge mass and gold nucleus charge data.
