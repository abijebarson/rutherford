# Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment - Simulation

This is a simulation of the *Classical* Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment.
You can change the radius of the Gold atom to see that the alpha particles are allowed when the concentration of charge is larger and backscattered when the radius is tiny compared to the atom.
